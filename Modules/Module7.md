# Python Programming (ITA6017) - Notes

## Module 7 - Embedded Product Life cycle

## Stages of Embedded Product Development Life Cycle

### The need phase

- This step can occur for a new product or re-engineering or updating a current product.

### Conceptualization phase

- Engineers might perform a cost-benefit analysis and begin project management, risk management, and other planning steps.

### Analysis phase

- During this phase, engineers outline the business needs for the product, along with requirements for developing the product.

### Design phase

- The engineers develop a preliminary design document, which establishes the overall architecture for the product and design.

### Development and testing phase

- Engineers build the product into actual hardware and software. They test the product to see how it performs and make changes to ensure it works well.

### Deployment phase

- The product manufacturer deploys the embedded product into the marketplace.

### Support phase

- The manufacturer and engineers continue to support the product. They monitor that it's working correctly and quickly make fixes where necessary.

### Upgrades phase

- The manufacturer and engineering team continue to work on possible new versions of the product that can perform better.

### Retirement/disposal:

- The manufacturer removes the product from the market as it becomes obsolete. This phase can happen as technology advances, and users' needs change.

## Summary

1. Specify the need for a project
2. Start project planning - Cost benefit analysis, risk management, etc.
3. Get the functional and non-functional requirements
4. Create a concept or early design on the system
5. Develop the system
6. Test the System
7. Deploy and install
8. Provide support
9. Upgrade the system
10. Retire the project
